Galvanize Data Science and Data Engineering (DSDE) educational products require that students have the ability to work
locally from individual machines.  These install guides provide the necessary context to ensure that students can
install and maintain a local environment.

.. important::
    You do not need administrator or root permissions to install Anaconda if you select a user-writable install
    location. However,  you will need administrator privileges for Docker.
