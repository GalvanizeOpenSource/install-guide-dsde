Zoom
=========

1. Install Zoom using the download for you operating system

    * `Zoom downloads <https://zoom.us/download>`_

    * `Zoom signup page <https://zoom.us/freesignup/>`_

Git and GitHub
================

Git is a `version control <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>`_ system that lets you track changes to files
containing text.  Often these files are scripts or other files that contain computer programming code.
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ through the use of `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ helps enable collaboration, resource
sharing and reproducible analytics.  You will need a
`GitHub supported web browser <https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/supported-browsers>`_ to complete
the assignments and tasks that are part of this learning experience.  You will also need to
`sign up for a GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_ if you do not have one already.  Basic GitHub accounts are
free. Please create one now if you do not have one already.

.. tip::

    There are a number of settings associated with your GitHub account.  For example, if you would like to keep your
    email address private see the `setting your email address documentation <https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address>`_.

Git for Windows
-----------------

    1. Download the `Git for Windows installer <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>`_.
    2. Run the installer and follow the steps below:
    3. Click on "Next" four times (two times if you've previously installed Git). You don't need to change anything in
       the Information, location, components, and start menu screens.
    4. Select "Use the nano editor by default" and click on `Next`.

    .. important::

        Keep **Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt** selected and click on `Next`. If you forgot to do this programs
        that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the
        appropriate option.

    5. Click on `Next`. Keep **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings** selected and click on `Next`.
       Select **Use Windows' default console window** and click on `Next`.

    6. Click on `Install`.
    7. Click on `Finish`.

If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):

1. Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type cmd and press [Enter])
2. Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:

.. code-block::
    bash

    ~$ setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"

3. Press `[Enter]` and you should see `SUCCESS: Specified value was saved`.

4. Quit command prompt by typing `exit` then pressing `[Enter]` This will provide you with both Git and
Bash in the Git Bash program.

Git for MacOS
----------------

If it is not already on your machine install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ (another package manager).

.. code-block::
    bash

    ~$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then install Git

.. code-block::
    bash

    ~$ brew install git

Git for Ubuntu Linux

.. code-block::
    bash

    ~$ sudo apt install git-all

See the `installing Git documentation <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ for more
information and troubleshooting.

Website restrictions
==============================

Some firewalls prevent access to certain websites.  You will need access to the following websites to ensure a
successful learning process.

* `https://github.com/ <https://github.com/>`_
* `https://learn-2.galvanize.com/ <https://learn-2.galvanize.com/>`_
* `https://vimeo.com/ <https://vimeo.com/>`_

We use Vimeo for pre-recorded lecture videos.  GitHub or more in general a centralized resource for version control
is a cornerstone of modern data science.
